# What is this?

This is a simple 1+2=3 solver, a Telegram game. Try it for yourself at first, it's quite fun :).

# Motivation

I was bored and wanted to see if I can code a script to solve it automatically, but also to flex a high score.

# Usage 

Simply run 
```
python main.py
```

which gives you a window of 5 seconds to open the game and start it. After the window elapsed, the script will start playing. Right now, it plays for 1000 rounds (or until it gets banned).
